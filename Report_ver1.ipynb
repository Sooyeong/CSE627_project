    " Why do we choose this project? - We choose this dataset for our project because of several reasons. Firstly, we can practice feature engineering by doing this project. Feature engineering in data scince is very important and this dataset contains a lot of features so, it is challenge enough to be a good project. The type of data is not restricted quantitative variable, it also contains qualitative dataset. Secondly, By doing this project we can practice from regularized model to Neural network based model so that we can have hands on expereince by doing this project\n",
