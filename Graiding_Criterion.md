### Introduction

This is the grading criterion for the first project. We are going to create Ipython notebook file with respect to this criterion. 


## Strategy

Planning part only accounts for 10% of the project, So, we can hide our data in seperate file... and explain why this approach is a valid approach for this problem
Data preprocessing part.



### Challege ->

Why this problem is important? A(~10%)  Challenge: Is the challenge appropriate for the group (the number of people may influence this). Did you take on a challenging, or unusual approach, or did you attempt to reproduce another kernel.  Although it is acceptable to try and reproduce another kernel as a starting  point, I expect the planning and the sequence of modifications to be your own. 
(~10%)  Planning:  Shows evidence that the group explored the data and found informative ways to visualize and pre-process it in order to simplify the target task.

(~30%)  Iteration:  Shows a sequence of modification, or perhaps an ablation study, in order to demonstrate the impact of a series of well-reasoned modifications to an initial approach. Presumably you start with the simplest approach that could possibly work and then improve it, motivating each change and then evaluating its effect. I expect to see around three different modifications to an initial approach in order to improve your results. 

(~45%)  Presentation: Presented in a clear and logical order; each step is explained in a way that demonstrates understanding. I do not have to ask "why?" as I read the report.  Care has been taken to explain things in a bit more detail than you think I actually need. Ideas are presented in a sequential way so that the problems and hypothesis are stated and a reasonable change is proposed and then tested. Your interpretations of the results are explained and are reasonable.  Figures and plots have titles, axes are labeled, and the text provides me with guidance on how to interpret visualizations (including tables) of the results. 

(~5%) Context:  You give credit to the sources for the ideas you implement. If an idea came from a paper, blog post, or another Kernel you cite them somehow (providing a link to the source is acceptable). If an idea came from discussion with a classmate or instructor you acknowledge them. 
 dvanced linear regression. Not a black box. Explain why this project is appropriate it. We need to justfy wh we choosed this project.
